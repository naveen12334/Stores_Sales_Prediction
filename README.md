# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Nowadays, shopping malls and Big Marts keep track of individual item sales data in order to forecast future client demand and adjust inventory management. In a data warehouse, these data stores hold a significant amount of consumer information and particular item details. By mining the data store from the data warehouse, more anomalies and common patterns can be discovered.

# Goal:
the goal is to predict the sales of the different stores of Big Mart according to the provided dataset based on the product,price.

# Approach:
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.

# Dataset:

# Project Various Steps:
# Data Transformation and Extraction:
Data is transformed into SQL Server from csv files and extract in python notebook from SQL Server through making a connection with pyodbc library.

# Train data:

# Test data:

# Data Exploration:
I started exploring datasets using pandas, NumPy,matplotlib and seaborn.

# Model Selection:
Made many Models But selected RandomForest Regressor.

# Hyperparameter Optimization:
Using Randomizedsearch CV to select the best parameter for training the model

# Model Dump:
As per selected trained model is dumped to pickled format for app development

# Model Accuracy 
# Training : 70%
# Testing  : 59%

# Export data with predicted result back to SQL Server:
